Any one remember Beach Head on the C64? Here's the 2000 version. You are one guy in a turret on the beast against the invading army. They come at you with attack choppers, multiple landing crafts, dozens and dozens of soldiers, tanks, attack jets, and more. All you got is your turret, which is armed with machine guns, missiles, and more. Shoot them all, and you'll get to the next level, which features even MORE bad guys to shoot... Occasionally you'll get supplies airdropped, and you must shoot the swinging crate BEFORE it hits the ground... Did I mention your ammo is limited?
